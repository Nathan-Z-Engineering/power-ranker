To track players follow the following format

etc...  
You can grab this player information using the query to get userid-discriminator.txt query.  

### Tokens
For this program to run you will need to generate your own Start.gg API tokens, from testing you will want to generate a minimum of 5 tokens and place them into a file named "tokens.txt" as the program will cycle through these tokens to bypass Start.gg API limits.

### Placements
After running the program a Placements.csv file will be generated that will have properly formatted player placements for every event tracked.
